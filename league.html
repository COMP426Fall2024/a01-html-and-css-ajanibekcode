                <p>Amaterasu, the Radiant Sun Goddess, would fit the role of a mage that would cause terror in the summoner rift. Below is a table of her potential abilties and power.</p>

                        <td>Radiant Presence: Empowers allies by giving nearby allies bonus attack speed and health regeneration. 
                        </td>
                        <td>Solar Flare: Amaterasu sends out a beam of concentrated sunlight in a straight line, dealing magic damage to enemy champions that are hit.</td>
                        <td>Sun's Blessing: Can heal either herself or nearby allies. Healing nearby allies grants her a temporary shield that protects her from stuns.</td>
                        <td>Dawn's Light: A short distance dash that leaves a trail of light, enemies who cross the trail are slowed for a few seconds.</td>
                        <td>Divine Radiance: Grants the ability to live a few seconds more, the same effect as Zhonya's Hourglass, and nearby allies within a small radius are granted this ability also. This is known as a time stop, rendering one untargetable and invulnerable for a short duration. However, the champion is unable to move, declare basic attacks, cast abilities, use summoner spells, or activate items.</td>
